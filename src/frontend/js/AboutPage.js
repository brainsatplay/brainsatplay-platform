                <p>Founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrettmflynn/">Garrett Flynn</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-brewster93/">Joshua Brewster</a> in Spring 2021, Brains@Play is an international movement to make neurotechnology accessible to everyone via browser-based biosensing infrastructure.</p>

                <p>To this end, we've created Brains@Play Platform as an open-source tool for the collaborative development and distribution of next-generation biosensing applications built by and for our community.</p>

                <p>For more information about our organization, please visit <a href="https://brainsatplay.com">https://brainsatplay.com</a>.
