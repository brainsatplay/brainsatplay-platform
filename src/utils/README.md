# utils

These are helper functions and classes created around the Brains@Play ecosystem. Specifically, **these are duplicated across the main brainsatplay.js repo and this brainsatplay-platform repo**. Make sure their functionality remains concurrent and, in time, publish separate NPM repositories as their features are well-tested.
