# apps
This is the directory where apps are stored. 

`app.manifest.js` is dynamically generated based on the file system.
`external.manifest.js` is hardcoded to represent a directory of applications that exist outside of this repository.
> Note: This will later be converted into a database with a nice UI

To add a new app, simply create a new subdirectory (e.g. `apps/General/myapp` and place your required files there.
