    <h3>Easy breathing exercises:</h3>
    <h4>Deep Diaphragmatic Breathing (increase score and HRV):</h4>
    <p>
      Take a slow deep breath over 5 seconds, then breathe out slowly for 5 seconds. Keep a steady (coherent) rate. <br>
      Do not try to strain yourself or hold your breath in.<br>
      The breathing should feel be a natural but slow ~6 breaths per minute rhythm that pushes your belly out and your diaphragm down. <br> 
      This will stimulate a vagus nerve response as well which causes brief but significant shifts in heart rate and blood pressure. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Relaxation breathing (reduces score)</h4>
    <p>
      With eyes closed: <br>
      Breathe out slowly over 7 seconds till you empty your lungs, then breathe back in for 3 seconds. <br>
      Focus on a point in the middle of your forehead and slowly move it down your body, or simply count your breaths. This keeps your mind occupied. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Jacobson's Progressive Muscular Relaxation Breathing</h4>
    <p>
      With eyes closed: <br>
      Another exercise is to breathe similarly to the first exercise but even slower while also tensing different muscle groups on the inhale, then relaxing them on the exhale. <br>
      Start in either your upper or lower body and work your way up/down through all of your muscle groups. <br>
      Tense up only once every two to three breathing cycles to give your body time to recover in-between.
    </p>
    <h4>Wim Hof Method</h4>
    <p>
      Take 30-40 rapid deep breaths, about 1 breath per second, and deep enough to extend and contract your diaphragm. <br>
      Then immediately ease into a very slow 5 seconds in 5 seconds out deep breathing pattern for about 3 to 4 breaths. <br>
      You can keep repeating this to intensify the effect.
